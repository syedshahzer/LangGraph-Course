You: write a pem about underwear
AI: Okay, here's a poem about underwear, aiming for a light and slightly humorous tone:

**The Silent Guardians**

They live in darkness, soft and low,
A secret comfort, a gentle glow.
The silent guardians of the day,
Protecting bottoms in a subtle way.

From cotton clouds to silky sheen,
A daily ritual, a private scene.
They’ve seen the sweat, the leaps, the sighs,
And held us steady ‘neath our thighs.

A simple purchase, often small,
Yet crucial to feeling good and tall.
Forgotten sometimes, a hurried plea,
“Where are my briefs? Oh, woe is me!”

They’re washed and folded, neat and bright,
Ready for action, morning, noon, and night.
A humble service, quietly done,
The loyal underwear, second to none.

Would you like me to:

*   Try a different style of poem (e.g., more serious, more playful)?
*   Focus on a specific type of underwear (e.g., boxers, briefs)?

You: make it a haiku
AI: 
Okay, here’s a haiku about underwear:

Soft whispers of cloth,
Holding secrets, warm and close,
Comfort’s gentle hug.

Do you want me to try another one, or perhaps a different kind of poem?
